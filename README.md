# Never's Minecraft Servers
Never's Minecraft Servers. Based on MCSManager. This is to collect issues.

# For Operators
Should you have any issues regarding the server itself, rather than mods or plugins, please create a new issue here or send an email to the address that is pinned on the login page.

# For Players
If you have any problems regarding:
1. In-game experience problems caused by mods or plugins, please contact the operators that belong to your server.
2. In-game experience problems caused by cheaters or modders, please contact the operators that belong to your server or me directly with a specific server address.
3. For other "game" relative problems, contact your operators first. If they cannot solve the problems, then contact me directly.

# How To Write An Issue
BEFORE OPENING AN ISSUE, search your problems first to check whether there is an existing issue. DO NOT SUBMIT duplicate issues.
1. Take screenshots of your problems and export the game logs.
2. Open a new issue.
3. Firstly write down the specific server NAME (NOT ADDRESS), game version and mod core (Like Forge/Bukkit or else).
4. Describe problems clearly.
5. Attach the error screenshots and game logs.
